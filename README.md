# Movie Collection

## Description
This is an Android application to scan the barcodes of a DVD or Blu-ray and store the movie's information in a user's collection. This allows the user to keep track of all the 
movies that they have in their personal collections. I created this application for personal use, and I thought it would be a great way to learn about application development. 

### Built With
This application was written in Java and built with Android Studio. It also uses Firebase to store the collection information for the user.

## Installation
Because this application was made for personal use, it is not available on any app stores. However, all the necessary files are included here and they can be downloaded.

## Usage
The first time you run the app, you will be prompted to either Log in or create an account.  
Then, you will be brought to the home page of the app and you can begin scanning movies.  
Once you scan a movie's barcode, relevant information is displayed and you have the option of adding it to your collection.  
You can also view all of the movies in your collection.  

## Project Status
The coding for this application is mostly done, but I still need to make some design changes to make the application look cleaner. And I will
also be adding some sort of visual preview of the application here in the near future.
